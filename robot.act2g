% The goTo action makes the agent move to a place (location) in the BW4T environment.
% As long as the agent has not arrived at the place it is going to, it will be in "traveling" mode.
define goTo(Location) with
	pre { not(state(traveling)) }
	post { true }

% Exercise 2.3a: insert a specification for the goToBlock(Block) action.
% The agent must be out of reach of the block and must be in a room. When it has reached the block it will be in "arrived" mode
define goToBlock(Block) with
	pre	{not(state(traveling)), not(atBlock(Block))}
	post { true }

% Exercise 2.3b: insert a specification for the pickUp action.
% Agent first doesn't hold the block and after the action it will hold it.
define pickUp(Block) with
	pre {not(holding(Block)), in(Room)}
	post{holding(Block),not(block(Block,Room)), takenFrom(Block,Room)}

% Exercise 2.3c: insert a specification for the putDown action.
% Same as pickup but reversed.
define putDown with
	pre	{holding(Block)}
	post {not(holding(Block))}
